# Uploads

Uploads
Allows you to upload large files in multiple parts.
Create upload
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/uploads
Creates an intermediate Upload object that you can add Parts to. Currently, an Upload can accept at most 8 GB in total and expires after an hour after you create it.
Once you complete the Upload, we will create a File object that contains all the parts you uploaded. This File is usable in the rest of our platform as a regular File object.
For certain purpose values, the correct mime_type must be specified. Please refer to documentation for the supported MIME types for your use case.
For guidance on the proper filename extensions for each purpose, please follow the documentation on creating a File.
Request body
bytes
integer
Required
The number of bytes in the file you are uploading.
filename
string
Required
The name of the file to upload.
mime_type

Required
The MIME type of the file.

This must fall within the supported MIME types for your file purpose. See the supported MIME types for assistants and vision.

The ID of the Upload.
Request body
part_ids
array
Required
The ordered list of Part IDs.
