# Server events

Server events
These are events emitted from the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket server to the client.
error
Returned when an error occurs, which could be a client problem or a server problem. Most errors are recoverable and the session will stay open, we recommend to implementors to monitor and log error messages by default.

conversation.item.added
Sent by the server when an Item is added to the default Conversation. This can happen in several cases:

When the client sends a conversation.item.create event.
When the input audio buffer is committed. In this case the item will be a user message containing the audio from the buffer.
When the model is generating a Response. In this case the conversation.item.added event will be sent when the model starts generating a specific Item, and thus it will not yet have any content (and status will be in_progress).
The event will include the full content of the Item (except when model is generating a Response) except for audio data, which can be retrieved separately with a conversation.item.retrieve event if necessary.

conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed
This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the user audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (when VAD is enabled). Transcription runs asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after the Response events.

Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model. The transcript may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

The index of the content part containing the audio.

conversation.item.truncated
Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the client with a conversation.item.truncate event. This event is used to synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

This action will truncate the audio and remove the server-side text transcript to ensure there is no text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

Returned when an input audio buffer is committed, either by the client or automatically in server VAD mode. The item_id property is the ID of the user message item that will be created, thus a conversation.item.created event will also be sent to the client.

input_audio_buffer.speech_started
Sent by the server when in server_vad mode to indicate that speech has been detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

The client should expect to receive a input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event when speech stops. The item_id property is the ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event (unless the client manually commits the audio buffer during VAD activation).

audio_start_ms
integer
Milliseconds from the start of all audio written to the buffer during the session when speech was first detected. This will correspond to the beginning of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the prefix_padding_ms configured in the Session.
event_id
string
The unique ID of the server event.

string
The ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops.

input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped
Returned in server_vad mode when the server detects the end of speech in the audio buffer. The server will also send an conversation.item.created event with the user message item that is created from the audio buffer.

audio_end_ms
integer
Milliseconds since the session started when speech stopped. This will correspond to the end of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the min_silence_duration_ms configured in the Session.

}
input_audio_buffer.timeout_triggered
Returned when the Server VAD timeout is triggered for the input audio buffer. This is configured with idle_timeout_ms in the turn_detection settings of the session, and it indicates that there hasn't been any speech detected for the configured duration.

The audio_start_ms and audio_end_ms fields indicate the segment of audio after the last model response up to the triggering time, as an offset from the beginning of audio written to the input audio buffer. This means it demarcates the segment of audio that was silent and the difference between the start and end values will roughly match the configured timeout.

The empty audio will be committed to the conversation as an input_audio item (there will be a input_audio_buffer.committed event) and a model response will be generated. There may be speech that didn't trigger VAD but is still detected by the model, so the model may respond with something relevant to the conversation or a prompt to continue speaking.

audio_end_ms
integer
